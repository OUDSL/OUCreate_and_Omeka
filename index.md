## Getting Started Using OU Create.
### Creating an account via your OU login
1. Go to [https://create.ou.edu/](https://create.ou.edu/) and click ***Get Started***. You will be asked to enter your OU Login.
2. You will now be asked to select your web domain name and which kind of domain you would like: **Custom Domain** or **Subdomain**: The difference between the two is cost and URL appearance.  A **Custom Domain** can be obtained for $12/year, and looks like [customdomain].com; this way has the option of ending in .org or .net as well. A **Subdomain** option from OU Create is offered for free to OU students, faculty, and staff. It looks like [freesubdomain].oucreate.com, meaning that it is rooted in OU create, but contains your personalized content. This option does not allow for .org or .net.
    - A tip for naming your domain: Think carefully about what you would like your domain name to be: generally speaking, OU create only allows each individual one (1) domain name, so make sure it is something relevant to you and/or your project. like your domain name to be: generally speaking, OU create only allows each individual one (1) domain name, so make sure it is something relevant to you and/or your project.
3. After selecting between Custom domain or subdomain, you will be directed to a 'Checkout' page If you selected the subdomain, your payment will be $0. Accept the Terms of Service, and click ***Order Now***.
